## TO-DO

- [] outsource each regressor model into a sub-directory
- [] create for each model a seperate file
- [] implement grid-search file
- [] implement basic time-series exploratory analysis capability
- [] enable multivariate implementation capability
- maybe:
- [] explore deep-learning models (tensor flow) 
- [] explore ml with quantum computing boosting
- ...
